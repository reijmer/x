# x

The goal of this project is to learn more about compilers and to implement a simple Python front end for LLVM.

Not all of this code is 100% my original work, I will add credits where due later.

This project is called x for the lack of a better name.

## build

To build you will need

flex
bison
llvm

run `make` in src/

## status

Working examples are included in `examples/`.


## short-term tasks

- add functions
- make this readme nicer
