# x

The goal of this project is to learn more about compilers and to implement a simple Python front end for LLVM.

Not all of this code is my original work, I will add credits where due later.

## status

Basic variable declaration and arithmetic is working. Printing integer values also works.

Working examples are included in `examples/`.
