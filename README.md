# x

This project is called x for the lack of a better name.

## goal

Primary goal is for me to learn more about compilers, llvm and c++. Secondary goal is to implement some (limited) Python syntax.

## build

To build you will need

- flex
- bison
- llvm

run `make` in src/

## status

Working examples are included in `examples/`. 


## short-term tasks

priority:
- error messages
- improve string support (single quoted strings and line breaks etc.)
- find a good way to test

then:
- add break for while loop
- add all python keywords to lexer
- add lists and dictionaries
- file imports


tasks i'll probably never get to:
- make this readme nicer
