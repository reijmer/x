# x

This project is called x for the lack of a better name.

## goal

Primary goal is for me to learn more about compilers, ARM assembly and c++. Secondary goal is to implement some (limited) Python syntax.

## build

To build you will need

- flex
- bison

run `make` in src/



tasks i'll probably never get to:
- make this readme nicer
